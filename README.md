LLM Project: Building a Large Language Model From Scratch
This repository contains the implementation of a Large Language Model (LLM) built following Sebastian Raschka's "Build a Large Language Model From Scratch" book. The project demonstrates the complete pipeline of building, training, and fine-tuning an LLM.

Project Overview
This project follows the three main stages of building an LLM:

Stage 1: Foundation Model

Data preparation and sampling

Implementing attention mechanisms

Building the LLM architecture

Pretraining on unlabeled data

Stage 2: Classification Model

Loading pretrained weights

Fine-tuning for text classification

Evaluating the classifier

Stage 3: Instruction-Following Assistant

Fine-tuning on instruction datasets

Creating a personal assistant model

Evaluating response quality

Key Components
The repository contains several notebooks:

blog_classifier.ipynb: Implementation of a blog classification model

blog_classifier_using.ipynb: Code for using the blog classifier

project_run_all_model.ipynb: Complete pipeline for training and using the models

Pushing_blog_classifier_to_github.ipynb: Code for pushing models to GitHub

Models
The project uses multiple models:

A blog classifier based on DistilBERT that categorizes blogs into four categories: World, Sports, Business, and Sci/Tech

An instruction-tuned model for generating responses to various instructions

The final implementation uses an Alpaca-trained model for improved results

Features
Text classification

Text summarization

Keyword extraction

Mind map generation

Custom instruction processing

Usage
The models can be used for:

Classifying blog posts into categories

Generating summaries of text

Extracting keywords from documents

Creating mind maps of content

Answering questions and following instructions

Technical Details
The instruction fine-tuning uses the Alpaca dataset (52,002 entries) for better performance

Models are implemented using PyTorch

The architecture is based on the transformer decoder (GPT-style)

The system first classifies input text and then processes it according to instructions

Requirements
PyTorch

Transformers

NLTK

NetworkX

Matplotlib

Scikit-learn
